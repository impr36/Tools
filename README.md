**Magic Number Check:**  
-The magic_db was incorrectly placed inside the magic_number_check method. It has been moved to the appropriate scope within the method for clarity.
-Added bounds checking in the match_magic function to prevent index errors when the file is too small to contain the header or footer.
-Fixed the Photoshop entry in magic_db (changed "FromHead" to "8BPS" for correct PSD file identification).
-Added error handling to catch and report issues during file reading or magic number analysis.
-Ensured file_type is properly defined by storing it in the instance (self.file_type) after the MIME detection.

**Error Handling:**  
-Added comprehensive error handling across all analysis methods (magic_number_check, entropy_analysis, header_spoof_check, byte_pattern_analysis, structure_validation, display_results, plot_entropy, and export_pdf) to prevent crashes and provide meaningful feedback to the user via the output text box or message boxes.
-Added checks for empty files or invalid file paths in analyze_file and other methods.

**Entropy Plot:**  
-Fixed the entropy plot to dynamically calculate bar width based on the number of entropy values to prevent overlap or incorrect scaling.
-Added error handling to display an error message on the canvas if plotting fails.

**Debug Information:**  
-Added a Debug field to analysis_results["magic"] to store detailed information about what happened during the analysis.
-The match_magic function now returns a tuple containing the matched entry (or None) and a debug message explaining why no match was found.
-Debug messages are inserted into the output text box to help identify the issue (e.g., "Empty file or no data read" or "No matching magic number found").

**File Validation:**  
-Added an explicit check for file existence and readability at the start of the method.

**Improved MIME Detection:**  
-Stored the file_type in self.file_type to ensure it's available for other methods.
-Added error handling to catch issues with python-magic and report them in the output.

**Robust Magic Number Matching:**  
-Ensured the file is checked for sufficient length before attempting to match headers or footers.
-Added a check for empty files in match_magic.

**Output Enhancement:**  
-The debug information is displayed in the output text box, making it easier to see why the file type is "Unknown".

**Notes:**  
The code assumes the tkinterdnd2, python-magic, and reportlab libraries are installed. Ensure they are available in your environment:
pip install tkinterdnd2 python-magic reportlab

On some systems, python-magic-bin may be needed instead of python-magic for Windows compatibility:
pip install python-magic-bin

The magic library requires libmagic to be installed on the system (e.g., libmagic1 on Ubuntu or file on macOS via Homebrew).

The entropy graph is a simple visualization. You may want to enhance it with labels or a scale for better usability.

The byte_pattern_analysis method uses a simplistic approach to EXE detection. Consider expanding the bigram database or using more sophisticated pattern analysis for real-world use.
